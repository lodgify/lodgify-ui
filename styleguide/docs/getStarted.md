Lodgify UI is a library of [React](https://reactjs.org/) components for developers building amazing websites with [Lodgify](https://www.lodgify.com/).

### Prior art

Lodgify UI stands on the shoulders of Semantic UI. It follows [the same principles](https://semantic-ui.com/usage/theming.html) and consumes a lot of [its code](https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction).

It is published using [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/).

### Using this documentation

On the sidebar you can see an index of all the components exposed by Lodgify UI.

Components are organised into categories from simple typography, elements and inputs through to oven-ready widgets to include in your site.

Each component is documented with:
* a brief description of its purpose,
* the import path to the component in the Lodgify UI npm package,
* a comprehensive description of each of its props and
* one or more examples of its usage.

You can use the code editors to modify the examples live in your browser.

```jsx
<Paragraph>Cool, huh?</Paragraph>
<Button onClick={() => console.log('Totally')}>Click me</Button>
```
